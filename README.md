# To Do List

> In this project, I build a simple HTML list of To Do tasks. The list will be styled according to the specifications listed later in this lesson. This simple web page will be built using webpack and served by a webpack dev server.

## Screen Short

My list is a clone of the part of the minimalist project captured in the video below.
